# Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer with a strong interest in backend development. My journey began with React and Next.js, and I quickly discovered the power of TypeScriptâ€”my first real exposure to static typing. Coming from a non-traditional background (International Business Management & Chinese), this discovery was a turning point that reshaped how I think about code.

Since then, I've gravitated toward typed languages like TypeScript, Python, and especially Go. Go's simplicity, powerful standard library, and expressive syntax make it a joy to work with.

I'm currently seeking opportunities in backend developmentâ€”ideally using Goâ€”but I'm also open to Python, Node.js, or even exploring Bun if you're using that.

Feel free to reach outâ€”I'd love to connect!
