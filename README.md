# Hey ðŸ‘‹

I've been enjoying web development using React and Next js for quite some time. Typescript revolutionised my thinking when writing code. It was the first time I had seen, or even heard of Types - I don't have a Computing based degree, my degree is in International Business Management and Chinese. From that point I've only wanted to write with types, whether TS or Py. Then I used Go and fell in love with it. The standard library is great and I really like and enjoy writing the syntax.

I'm on the lookout for a role in backend development, prefarrably using Go, but I would be open to Python and Node too, or if you're rolling out Bun JS, I'd be interested in getting to know that, too!

Let's talk!
