<!-- # Hey 👋 -->

<!-- I'm a developer with a strong interest in backend development. My journey began with React and Next.js, and I quickly discovered the power of TypeScript—my first real exposure to static typing. Coming from a non-traditional background (International Business Management & Chinese), this discovery was a turning point that reshaped how I think about code. -->

<!-- Since then, I've gravitated toward typed languages like TypeScript, Python (I know! it's not typed! but I enforce typing through LSP), and especially Go. Go's simplicity, powerful standard library, and expressive syntax make it a joy to work with. -->

<!-- I'm currently seeking opportunities in backend development—ideally using Go—but I'm also open to Python, Node.js, or even exploring Bun if you're using that. -->

<!-- Feel free to reach out—I'd love to connect! -->
